  <h1> 1963 Michael Jeffrey Jordan is born in Brooklyn, New York  </h1>
  <p1> Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963) is a retired American professional basketball player and active businessman.</p1>

<p>His biography on the National Basketball Association (NBA) website states, "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time." Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p>Jordan was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Deloris (née Peoples), who worked in banking, and James R. Jordan, Sr., an equipment supervisor. His family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, when he was a toddler .Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he anchored his athletic career by playing baseball, football, and basketball. He tried out for the varsity basketball team during his sophomore year, but at 5'11" (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, Harvest Leroy Smith, was the only sophomore to make the team.</p>

<p>Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity squad, and tallied several 40 point games. The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play. As a senior, he was selected to the McDonald's All-American Team after averaging a triple-double: 29.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, and 10.1 assists.</p>

  <h1> 1981 Get a schoolarship with University of North Carolina</h1>
  <p>In 1981, Jordan earned a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of Omega Psi Phi and majored in cultural geography.<p/>

<p>As a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, he was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 points per game (ppg) on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rebounds per game (rpg). After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA Draft.</p>

  <h1>1984-1985 Enter the NBA Draft</h1>
  <p>After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA Draft.</p>

<p>The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.</p>

<p>During his first season in the NBA, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting.</p>

<p>He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas, and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading "A Star is Born" just over a month into his professional career. Jordan was also voted in as an All-Star starter by the fans in his rookie season. Controversy arose before the All-Star game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving. This led to a so called "freeze-out" on Jordan, where players refused to pass him the ball throughout the game. The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted Rookie of the Year. The Bulls finished the season 38–44, and lost in the first round of the playoffs in four games to the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>

       <p>Michael Jordan Averages 32.5 Points Per Game, Winning the MVP Award and Defensive Player of the Year</p>
       <p>Jordan led the league in scoring again in the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting and won his first league MVP award.</p>

<p>He was also named the Defensive Player of the Year, as he had averaged 1.6 blocks and a league high 3.16 steals per game. The Bulls finished 50–32, and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons, who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the "Bad Boys".</p>

       <h1>1991-Michael Jordan win the NBA Championship with Chicago Bulls for the first time in his career</h1>
       
       <p1>1991 NBA Finals:</p1>
<p2>Chicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic "switch hands" layup.  </p2>
       <p>The Chicago Bulls Defeat the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5 of the 1991 NBA Finals
The Bulls would defeat the Lakers in 4 games to 1. This would ultimately turn out to be Magic Johnson's last NBA Finals appearance, who was without James Worthy and Byron Scott, the Laker's #2 and #3 scorers, in the final game.</p>

<p>Thus, the only win for the Lakers came in Game 1 when Sam Perkins (Michael Jordan's former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill teammate) hit the game winning 3 point shot. Later in the final seconds, Jordan's chance for a game-winner rattled out.</p>

<p>Other memorable moments came when Jordan shot 15 of 18 from the floor in Game 2 including a layup when, attempting to dunk, avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching hands in midair and laying the ball up with his left. The play became so popular that it would come to be known as "The Move" (in Chicago).</p>

<p>Jordan also sent Game 3 (a game the Bulls eventually won) to overtime with a game tying jumper, a first of many such heroics for him on the NBA's greatest stage.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan unanimously won his first NBA Finals MVP award (to go with his regular season MVP award and his fifth straight scoring title), and wept while holding his first NBA Finals trophy.</p>
